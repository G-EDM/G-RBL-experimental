# Note

After first inserting a SD card into the ILI SD port on the display the firmware will create
the required directory tree.

Place the setting files into the settings folder.

The files are not compatible with the old firmware.

DPM/DPH voltage and current settings are not restored and need to be set manually.


The settings file for aluminum is just a very rough example. Not very accurate and 
I will refine it. But it gives a good starting point as Aluminum is not
very EDM friendly. It creates an oxid layer very quick and then stops conducting.

The cut needs to remove material faster then the oxidation can happen.

I made a cut in 20mm Aluminum with the settings and it did the cut in a single pass.
